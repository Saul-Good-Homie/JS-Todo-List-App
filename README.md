In this project I am creating a simple ToDo app. The purpose of this project is to practice the module pattern, Object Oriented Programming, using NPM and webpacker and using javascript to create and manipulate DOM elements. This site uses Skeleton CSS for basic styles and structure.

This is a Javascript project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/todo-list)
